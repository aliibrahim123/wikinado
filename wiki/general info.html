<h2>introduction</h2>
<p>A tornado is a powerful and destructive natural phenomenon characterized by a rapidly rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground. Tornadoes come in various shapes and sizes, ranging from small and weak to large and violent. They are capable of causing widespread damage and pose a significant threat to both life and property.</p>
<h2>Formation Process</h2>
<p>Tornadoes form in severe thunderstorms when warm, moist air at the surface meets cold, dry air aloft, creating an unstable atmosphere. The interaction of these air masses, combined with wind patterns, can lead to the development of a rotating column of air -the precursor to a tornado. If this rotation intensifies and extends to the ground, a tornado is born.</p>
<h2>General Appearance:</h2>
<p>Tornadoes come in various shapes and sizes, but they all share some common features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Funnel cloud</strong>: The most recognizable part of a tornado is the funnel cloud, a cone-shaped cloud that extends from the base of the thunderstorm cloud to the ground. It is formed by the condensation of moisture in the spinning air.</li>
<li><strong>Debris cloud</strong>: As a tornado moves across the ground, it picks up debris, such as dust, leaves, and even houses, which creates a swirling cloud around the funnel cloud.</li>
<li><strong>High winds</strong>: Tornadoes are known for their high winds, which can reach speeds of over 200 miles per hour. These winds are responsible for the majority of the damage caused by tornadoes.</li>
<li><strong>Rotation</strong>: Tornadoes rotate counterclockwise in most parts of the world, except in Australia, where they rotate clockwise due to the Coriolis effect.</li>
</ul>
<h2>common types</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Waterspouts</strong>: These tornadoes form over water, often appearing as slender columns sucking water upwards. They can be just as powerful as land tornadoes and can even transition onto land.</li>
<li><strong>Landspouts</strong>: Weaker than typical tornadoes, landspouts form over land without a parent thunderstorm cloud. They are usually short-lived and less destructive.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple-vortex tornadoes</strong>: These rare tornadoes contain two or more smaller vortices rotating within a larger one. They can be incredibly destructive, with each vortex capable of causing significant damage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Intensity</h2>
<p>The Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale classifies tornadoes based on estimated wind speeds and potential damage. The scale ranges from EF0 (weakest) to EF5 (strongest).</p>
<h2>Impact and Damage</h2>
<p>Tornadoes can leave a path of destruction in their wake, causing damage to buildings, infrastructure, and vegetation. The impact of a tornado is influenced by factors such as its intensity, path width, and duration. Tornadoes can also produce secondary hazards, including flash floods and hail.</p>
