<p>Several atmospheric phenomena share similarities in their rotating or swirling naturetot tornados, each occurring under specific conditions.</p>
<h2>Gustnado:</h2>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p> A gustnado is a small and short-lived tornado-like circulation that forms along the gust front of a severe thunderstorm. Unlike traditional tornadoes, gustnadoes do not extend from a supercell&#39;s mesocyclone.</p>
<h4>Formation</h4>
<p> Gustnadoes form in the outflow of a thunderstorm, where cool air from the storm downdraft collides with warm air near the ground, creating a rotating column. They are often weaker than tornadoes but can cause damage.</p>
<h4>Characteristics</h4>
<p> Gustnadoes typically appear as small, low-lying, and dusty whirlwinds. They may be mistaken for tornadoes, but they are distinct in their formation and behavior.</p>
<h4>Behavior</h4>
<p> Gustnadoes are often short-lived and may dissipate rapidly. They are not directly connected to a parent thunderstorm&#39;s updraft and are considered non-tornadic.</p>
<h2>Dust Devil:</h2>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p> A dust devil is a small, well-formed whirlwind that picks up dust or debris from the ground. They are most common in dry and arid regions but can occur in various environments.</p>
<h4>Formation</h4>
<p> Dust devils form when the ground heats up, creating localized, rising thermals. As these thermals rotate, they lift dust or debris, forming a visible column.</p>
<h4>Characteristics</h4>
<p> Dust devils are typically smaller than tornadoes and have a more defined, slender shape. They are not associated with thunderstorms and are often harmless.</p>
<h4>Behavior</h4>
<p> Dust devils are generally short-lived, lasting from a few seconds to several minutes. While they are usually not dangerous, larger dust devils can cause minor damage.</p>
<h2>Fire Whirls:</h2>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p> Also known as fire tornadoes or firenadoes, fire whirls are spinning vortices of flame and smoke that develop within or near intense wildfires.</p>
<h4>Formation</h4>
<p> Fire whirls form when intense heat and turbulence create a rotating updraft. The interaction of winds with the fire&#39;s heat can lead to the development of a vertically rotating column.</p>
<h4>Characteristics</h4>
<p> Fire whirls can range in size and intensity. Large fire whirls may resemble tornadoes but are distinct in their formation within the context of a wildfire.</p>
<h4>Behavior</h4>
<p> Fire whirls can be highly dynamic, moving erratically and posing a significant danger during wildfires. While most fire whirls are small, larger and more intense fire whirls can cause extreme fire behavior.</p>
<h2>Steam Devils:</h2>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p> Steam devils, also known as steam whirlwinds or steam tornadoes, are rotating columns of steam or mist that develop over bodies of warm water.</p>
<h4>Formation</h4>
<p> Steam devils form when cold air moves over warm water, causing the warm, moist air near the surface to rise. The rising air can create a rotating column of steam.</p>
<h4>Characteristics</h4>
<p> Steam devils are typically less well-defined than tornadoes and may appear as misty columns or vortices over bodies of water.</p>
<h4>Behavior</h4>
<p> Steam devils are generally harmless and are more of a meteorological curiosity than a significant atmospheric phenomenon. They are common in colder weather over warm water bodies.</p>
