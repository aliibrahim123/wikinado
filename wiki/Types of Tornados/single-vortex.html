<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>A single-vortex tornado is a tornado that features one main and well-defined rotating column of air extending from a thunderstorm cloud to the ground. This tornado type is distinguished by the absence of multiple smaller sub-vortices within the main column. The rotation is typically counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere, following the Earth&#39;s natural rotation.</p>
<h2>Characteristics:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Funnel Shape</strong>: Single-vortex tornadoes often exhibit a classic funnel shape, narrowing toward the ground. The funnel is the visible manifestation of the rotating column of air.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Increased Intensity</strong>: With all the energy channeled into one funnel, single-vortex tornadoes can reach extreme wind speeds, making them potentially more destructive than their multivortex counterparts.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Relatively Predictable Path</strong>: While still unpredictable, single-vortex tornadoes tend to follow less erratic paths compared to their multi-vortex counterparts. Their movements are often more straight-line or with smoother curves, making them slightly easier to anticipate.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>super speads</strong>: They can reach wind speeds exceeding 300 kilometers per hour, enough to rip apart buildings and toss vehicles like toys.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Predictable Formation</strong>: The formation of a single-vortex tornado is often associated with the presence of a well-defined mesocyclone, a rotating updraft within a supercell thunderstorm. This makes them somewhat easier to predict than multivortex tornadoes arising from complex storm dynamics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
