<p>When a tornado is imminent, taking swift and decisive action is crucial to ensure the safety of yourself and those around you. Here&#39;s a guide on preparedness during tornadoes:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Stay Informed</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor weather updates through a NOAA weather radio, local news, or weather apps.</li>
<li>Take tornado warnings seriously and act promptly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Seek Shelter Immediately</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Head to your designated safe room or the lowest level of your home, preferably a basement.</li>
<li>If you don&#39;t have a basement, choose an interior room on the lowest floor, away from windows and doors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Avoid Windows</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay away from windows, glass doors, and skylights.</li>
<li>Protect yourself from flying debris by getting to the most interior part of the building.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cover Yourself</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use heavy furniture, mattresses, or sturdy materials to create a protective barrier around you.</li>
<li>If possible, get under a staircase or a heavy piece of furniture for additional protection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Wear Protective Gear</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have access to helmets, bike helmets, or even a mattress, use them to protect your head from potential flying debris.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Listen for Updates</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep a battery-powered weather radio with you to receive updates if the power goes out.</li>
<li>Pay attention to official announcements and instructions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Stay Calm</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage others around you to remain calm.</li>
<li>Take deep breaths and focus on your emergency plan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Charge Mobile Devices</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that your mobile devices are fully charged before the storm hits.</li>
<li>Use them sparingly to conserve battery power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Wait for the All Clear</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remain in your safe location until you receive an official all-clear signal.</li>
<li>Do not go outside prematurely, as there may be multiple tornadoes in a single storm system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Help Others</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assist children, elderly family members, and individuals with disabilities in reaching safety.</li>
<li>Check on neighbors and offer help if it&#39;s safe to do so.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Be Prepared for Aftermath</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be cautious when leaving your shelter, as there may be debris and hazards.</li>
<li>Watch out for downed power lines and other dangers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Communicate</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact your out-of-town emergency contact to let them know you are safe.</li>
<li>Use text messages instead of calls to conserve phone battery and network capacity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, the key to survival during a tornado is preparedness, quick decision-making, and following safety guidelines. Regularly practicing tornado drills with your family or community can significantly improve everyone&#39;s ability to respond effectively during an actual emergency.</p>
