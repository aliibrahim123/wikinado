## Doppler Radar
While Doppler radar is instrumental in detecting forming tornadoes, it continues to be a crucial tool for tracking established ones. By analyzing reflected signals, meteorologists can measure a tornado's wind speed, direction, and size, providing essential information for issuing warnings and predicting its path accurately.

## Advanced Radar Techniques
Doppler radar can employ specialized techniques such as velocity track display (VTD) and dual-polarization to gather more detailed information about the tornado's structure and evolution. These techniques reveal changes in intensity, aiding in the prediction of movement and potential threats associated with the tornado.

## Mobile Radar Units
Deployed post-initial detection, mobile radar units can follow the tornado's path, offering continuous updates on its location and intensity. Real-time data from these units is critical for emergency response teams, providing valuable information to assess potential damage areas and plan interventions effectively.

## Satellite Imagery
While not as precise as radar, satellite imagery provides a broad view of the tornado's location and its interaction with larger cloud systems. This information aids in tracking the storm's path over longer distances and predicting its direction of movement, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the tornado's behavior.

## Ground Observers
Trained storm spotters remain a valuable resource for tracking established tornadoes, particularly in rural areas. Their visual observations of the tornado's size, shape, and debris provide vital on-the-ground information, refining predictions and warnings issued by meteorologists.

## Storm Chasers
Although not directly involved in official tracking, experienced storm chasers equipped with specialized radar and camera equipment contribute valuable data and close-up observations of tornadoes. This firsthand information, shared with meteorologists and emergency response teams, enhances the overall understanding of the storm and aids in refining response strategies.

## Lidar Technology
Lidar, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, is a technology that uses laser light to measure distances. While not as commonly employed as radar, lidar can provide additional insights into tornado dynamics. Lidar systems can detect airborne particles within a tornado, offering information about the tornado's internal structure and intensity.

## Phased-Array Radar
Phased-array radar systems offer increased flexibility in scanning the atmosphere compared to traditional radar. With the ability to rapidly adjust their scanning patterns, these radar systems can provide more frequent and detailed updates on tornado development and movement, enhancing forecasting accuracy.

## Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
Drones equipped with various sensors, including cameras and thermal imaging, can be deployed to survey tornado-affected areas. These UAVs provide high-resolution aerial imagery, aiding in damage assessment, especially in areas that are challenging to access immediately after a tornado.

## Smartphone Technology
Advancements in smartphone technology allow individuals to contribute to tornado tracking efforts. Weather apps with real-time reporting features enable users to share their location, photos, and observations during severe weather events. This crowdsourced data can complement official tracking methods.
