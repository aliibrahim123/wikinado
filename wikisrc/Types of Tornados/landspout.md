## Definition:
Landspouts are tornadoes that form over land and are not associated with the mesocyclones of supercell thunderstorms. Unlike traditional tornadoes, which are spawned by rotating updrafts within supercells, landspouts develop from the ground up and are generally considered to be less intense.

## Formation:
Landspouts form in environments with atmospheric instability and weak wind shear. They originate from the ground, often beneath developing cumulus or towering cumulus clouds. The process involves the stretching and tilting of a horizontally rotating column of air, leading to a vertical column that becomes a tornado. Unlike supercell tornadoes, which descend from a mesocyclone, landspouts are not connected to a parent thunderstorm's updraft.

## Characteristics:
- **Size**: Landspouts are generally smaller than classic tornadoes, rarely exceeding a kilometer in diameter and usually reaching heights of less than 100 meters.

- **Funnel Shape**: Landspouts typically exhibit a narrow, rope-like funnel that extends from the cloud base to the ground. The funnel is usually less well-defined than those of supercell tornadoes.

- **Wind Speeds**: Despite their smaller size, landspouts can still pack a punch, with wind speeds reaching up to 130 kilometers per hour in extreme cases. These winds can cause significant damage to structures, trees, and power lines.

- **Shorter Lifespan**: Compared to the potentially hours-long duration of some land tornadoes, landspouts tend to be a fleeting phenomenon, often lasting only a few minutes to half an hour. Their existence is often transient, appearing and disappearing with surprising swiftness.

- **Less Predictable**: Due to their localized formation conditions and lack of association with large storm systems, landspouts can be more unpredictable than traditional tornadoes.

## Behavior:
- **Movement**: Landspouts can exhibit varied movement patterns, often skipping, hopping, or changing direction abruptly. They may wander erratically across the landscape, making them difficult to track and posing a challenge for those in their path.

- **Transition to Land Tornadoes**: While rare, landspouts can occasionally transition into full-fledged land tornadoes if they encounter favorable conditions like strong wind shear or increased moisture availability.

- **Debris Dance**: Although they may not pick up as much debris as their larger cousins, landspouts can still toss around lighter objects like leaves, branches, and even small structures.
