## Definition
A single-vortex tornado is a tornado that features one main and well-defined rotating column of air extending from a thunderstorm cloud to the ground. This tornado type is distinguished by the absence of multiple smaller sub-vortices within the main column. The rotation is typically counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere, following the Earth's natural rotation.

## Characteristics:
- **Funnel Shape**: Single-vortex tornadoes often exhibit a classic funnel shape, narrowing toward the ground. The funnel is the visible manifestation of the rotating column of air.

- **Increased Intensity**: With all the energy channeled into one funnel, single-vortex tornadoes can reach extreme wind speeds, making them potentially more destructive than their multivortex counterparts.

- **Relatively Predictable Path**: While still unpredictable, single-vortex tornadoes tend to follow less erratic paths compared to their multi-vortex counterparts. Their movements are often more straight-line or with smoother curves, making them slightly easier to anticipate.

- **super speads**: They can reach wind speeds exceeding 300 kilometers per hour, enough to rip apart buildings and toss vehicles like toys.

- **Predictable Formation**: The formation of a single-vortex tornado is often associated with the presence of a well-defined mesocyclone, a rotating updraft within a supercell thunderstorm. This makes them somewhat easier to predict than multivortex tornadoes arising from complex storm dynamics.
