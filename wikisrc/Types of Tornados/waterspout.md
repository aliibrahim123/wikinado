## Definition:
A waterspout is a tornado that occurs over a body of water. They can develop over oceans, lakes, or other water bodies, and they are categorized into two main types: tornadic waterspouts and fair-weather waterspouts.
- **Tornadic Waterspouts**: Form in association with severe thunderstorms and are essentially tornadoes over water.
- **Fair-Weather Waterspouts**: Form in relatively calm weather conditions, often beneath developing cumulus clouds.

## formation
### Tornadic Waterspouts:
Tornadic waterspouts form in conjunction with severe thunderstorms over large bodies of water. As a thunderstorm matures, updrafts and downdrafts within the storm can create an environment conducive to the development of a mesocycloneâ€”a rotating updraft. When this mesocyclone extends over water, it can lead to the formation of a tornadic waterspout. The rotating column of air connects the storm's base with the water surface, and the characteristic funnel cloud becomes visible.

### Fair-Weather Waterspouts:
Fair-weather waterspouts, on the other hand, typically form in relatively calm weather conditions beneath developing cumulus clouds, often during the morning or early afternoon. The process begins with the heating of the water surface, causing warm, moist air to rise. This rising air creates a region of low pressure, drawing in surrounding air. If there is enough wind shear in the atmosphere, the rising air can start to spin horizontally. As the spinning column tightens and extends downward, a fair-weather waterspout is born. Unlike tornadic waterspouts, fair-weather waterspouts are not associated with mature thunderstorms.

## characteristic
- **Size**: Waterspouts are generally smaller than land tornadoes, with most reaching heights of 30 to 100 meters and having a diameter of 10 to 50 meters. However, some can grow much larger, mimicking their terrestrial counterparts.

- **Color**: Waterspouts often appear white or gray, reflecting the water droplets and clouds from which they form. However, they can also take on mesmerizing hues of blue or green when sunlight illuminates them from particular angles, creating a spectacle of light and water.

- **Funnel Shape**: As with tornadoes, waterspouts can exhibit different funnel shapes. The classic rope-like column is common, but wider funnels and even elephant trunks can occur.

- **Wind Speeds**: Wind speeds within waterspouts can vary greatly, ranging from gentle breezes in fair-weather types to exceeding 200 kilometers per hour in tornadic waterspouts.

- **Debris and Spray**: Unlike land tornadoes, waterspouts primarily pick up water and foam, creating a swirling spray around the base of the funnel. In rare cases, they can also suck up objects like boats or fish.

- **Multiple Vortices**: Like tornadoes, waterspouts can exhibit multiple vortices, swirling within the main funnel. This can create a mesmerizing dance of smaller whirlwinds, adding to the visual complexity of the spectacle.

## Behavior:
- **Movement**: Waterspouts can be surprisingly mobile, often moving erratically across the water's surface. They can travel at speeds of up to 50 kilometers per hour, making them difficult to predict and potentially dangerous for mariners.

- **Lifespan**: While some waterspouts last only a few minutes, others can persist for up to an hour, especially tornadic ones.

- **Dissipation**: Waterspouts typically dissipate when the conditions that formed them weaken. Loss of warm air or weakening of the rotational force eventually leads to the funnel fading and the waterspout collapsing.

- **Interaction with Land**: When waterspouts make landfall, they can transform into tornadoes, posing a significant threat to coastal communities. This transition can happen quickly.
