## history
Tornadoes are classified using various scales that take into account factors such as wind speed and damage potential. One widely recognized classification system is the Fujita scale, developed by Dr. Ted Fujita in 1971. This scale categorizes tornadoes from F0 to F5 based on the estimated wind speeds and associated damage.

In 2007, the Fujita scale was refined and replaced by the Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale, addressing some of the limitations of the original scale. The Enhanced Fujita scale also categorizes tornadoes from EF0 to EF5, but it incorporates more specific damage indicators and a wider range of estimated wind speeds for each category.

## Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale
#### EF0 (Weak):    
**Wind Speeds**: 65-85 mph (105-137 km/h)    
**Frequency**: 52.82%     
**Damage**: Light damage. Some damage to chimneys, branches broken off trees, shallow-rooted trees uprooted, and signboards damaged.

#### EF1 (Moderate):
**Wind Speeds**: 86-110 mph (138-177 km/h)    
**Frequency**: 32.98%     
**Damage**: Moderate damage. The tornado is capable of causing considerable damage. Roofs may be peeled off, mobile homes overturned, and poorly constructed signs destroyed.

#### EF2 (Significant):
**Wind Speeds**: 111-135 mph (178-217 km/h)    
**Frequency**: 8.41%     
**Damage**: Significant damage. The tornado can produce considerable structural damage. Well-constructed houses may have their roofs torn off, and mobile homes can be completely destroyed.

#### EF3 (Severe):
**Wind Speeds**: 136-165 mph (218-266 km/h)    
**Frequency**: 2.18%     
**Damage**: Severe damage. The tornado is capable of causing devastating damage. Entire stories of well-constructed houses may be destroyed, and large trees snapped or uprooted.

#### EF4 (Extreme):
**Wind Speeds**: 166-200 mph (267-322 km/h)    
**Frequency**: 0.46%     
**Damage**: Devastating damage. Well-constructed houses and entire frame houses may be leveled. High-end EF4 tornadoes can leave only a concrete slab behind where a house once stood.

#### EF5 (Catastrophic):
**Wind Speeds**: Over 200 mph (over 322 km/h)    
**Frequency**: 0.05%     
**Damage**: Incredible damage. The tornado is capable of causing catastrophic damage. Strong-framed houses can be lifted off their foundations and carried considerable distances. High-end EF5 tornadoes can sweep the ground clean of vegetation and cause significant debarking of trees.
