## Formation
Tornadoes form as a result of the intense interplay between warm, moist air and cool, dry air. The formation typically begins when warm, humid air near the ground rises and meets a layer of cooler air. As the warm air ascends, it cools, and moisture condenses to form cumulonimbus clouds. If strong winds at different altitudes create a horizontal spinning effect, known as wind shear, within the storm system, it can tilt the updraft and start the formation of a rotating column of air, called a mesocyclone. When this rotating column extends downward and makes contact with the ground, a tornado is born. The tornado's funnel cloud is the visible manifestation of this violent vortex, drawing in air and debris as it moves across the landscape.

## Maturity
The maturity phase of a tornado is when it's at its most powerful and destructive state. During this stage, the tornado's rotating column of air, often visible as a well-defined funnel cloud, is fully formed and extends from the base of the thunderstorm to the ground. The tornado moves with great speed and can cause severe damage to anything in its path. The strong updraft within the tornado sustains the rotating column, maintaining its intensity. This phase is often accompanied by intense atmospheric conditions, including powerful winds and extreme atmospheric pressure differentials, contributing to the tornado's strength

## Dissipation
The dissipation phase of a tornado signifies the conclusion of its life cycle, as the twister gradually weakens and ultimately disappears. This phase is driven by the depletion of the warm air that initially fueled the tornado's formation. As the tornado moves away from its source of warm, moist air, it loses the energy required to sustain its rotation. Additionally, interactions with the Earth's surface, such as encountering friction and obstacles, contribute to the tornado's diminishing intensity. The dissipation phase serves as a natural conclusion to the tornado's presence, highlighting the ebbing of its destructive power and potential threat.
