## United States:
**Tornado Alley**: The central United States, particularly the region known as Tornado Alley, experiences a high frequency of tornadoes. This area includes parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The collision of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico with cool, dry air from the Rocky Mountains creates favorable conditions for tornado formation.

## Central Plains of South America:
**Argentina and Uruguay**: South America experiences tornadoes, with the central plains of Argentina and Uruguay being particularly prone to tornado activity. Tornadoes in this region are often associated with severe thunderstorms.

## Bangladesh and Eastern India:
**Tornadoes in the Bengal Delta**: Bangladesh and parts of eastern India, especially the Bengal Delta, are known for tornado occurrences. These tornadoes are often associated with powerful cyclones that make landfall in the Bay of Bengal.

## Australia:
**Southeast Australia**: While tornadoes can occur in various parts of Australia, they are more common in the southeastern regions, including Victoria and New South Wales. Australian tornadoes are typically associated with severe thunderstorms.

## Canada:
**Southern Canada**: Tornadoes occur in various provinces of Canada, with southern regions such as Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta experiencing tornado activity. The frequency is lower than in the United States.

## Europe:
**United Kingdom and Central Europe**: Tornadoes are relatively infrequent in Europe compared to the United States, but they do occur. The United Kingdom, France, and parts of central Europe experience tornadoes, often associated with severe convective weather systems.

## South Africa:
**Highveld Region**: Tornadoes occur in South Africa, particularly in the Highveld region. Similar to other tornado-prone areas, they are often associated with severe thunderstorms.

## Asian Tornadoes:
**Japan and South Korea**: Tornadoes are known to occur in Japan and South Korea, typically during the spring and early summer months. These tornadoes are often associated with the collision of contrasting air masses.

## Factors that Influence Distribution:
- **Geography**: Mountain ranges, large bodies of water, and land-sea interactions can influence wind patterns and create conditions conducive to tornadoes.
- **Climate**: Warm, humid air and strong winds are key ingredients, while stable air masses like those over oceans typically suppress tornado formation.
- **Seasonality**: Regions with distinct warm and cool seasons are more likely to see tornadoes during the transition periods.
