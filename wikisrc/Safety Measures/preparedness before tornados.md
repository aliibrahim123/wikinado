Preparing for tornadoes is crucial to ensure the safety of yourself and your loved ones. Tornadoes are powerful and unpredictable natural disasters that can cause extensive damage within a short period. Here are some key steps to take for preparedness before tornadoes:

1. **Create a Family Emergency Plan:**
	- Develop a comprehensive emergency plan that includes evacuation routes, emergency contacts, and a meeting point.
	- Ensure that all family members are familiar with the plan and practice it through regular drills.

2. **Designate a Safe Room:**
	- Identify a safe room in your home, preferably in a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor without windows.
	- If you live in a mobile home or temporary structure, make plans to seek safer shelter in a nearby sturdy building.

3. **Emergency Supplies Kit:**
	- Prepare an emergency supplies kit that includes essential items such as non-perishable food, water, flashlight, batteries, first aid kit, medications, important documents, and a weather radio.
	- Regularly check and update the kit to ensure that all items are in good condition and within their expiration dates.

4. **Stay Informed:**
	- Keep abreast of weather conditions by using a NOAA weather radio, weather apps, or a local news channel.
	- Understand tornado watches and warnings:
		- A tornado watch means conditions are favorable for tornadoes, and you should be prepared.
		- A tornado warning means a tornado has been spotted, and immediate action is necessary.

5. **Community Warning Systems:**
	- Familiarize yourself with community warning systems and sirens. Know the signals and what they mean.
	- Understand the difference between tornado watches and tornado warnings.

6. **Secure Your Home:**
	- Reinforce your home's structure, especially the roof, doors, and windows.
	- Consider installing storm shutters and reinforcing garage doors.

7. **Create a Communication Plan:**
	- Establish a communication plan with family members and neighbors.
	- Choose an out-of-town contact person who can serve as a central point of contact in case local communication is disrupted.

8. **Emergency Contacts:**
Make a list of emergency contacts, including local authorities, neighbors, and relatives, and keep it in a readily accessible location.

9. **Practice Situational Awareness:**
	- Stay aware of weather conditions, and be prepared to take action if tornado warnings are issued.
	- Pay attention to the sky and any changes in weather patterns.

10. **Insurance and Documentation:**
	- Review your insurance policies to ensure you have adequate coverage for potential tornado damage.
	- Keep important documents, such as insurance policies, identification, and medical records, in a secure and easily accessible location.

Remember that preparedness is an ongoing process, and regularly reviewing and updating your plans and supplies is essential to staying safe during tornadoes or any other emergencies.
