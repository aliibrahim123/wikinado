When a tornado is imminent, taking swift and decisive action is crucial to ensure the safety of yourself and those around you. Here's a guide on preparedness during tornadoes:

1. **Stay Informed**:
	- Monitor weather updates through a NOAA weather radio, local news, or weather apps.
	- Take tornado warnings seriously and act promptly.

2. **Seek Shelter Immediately**:
	- Head to your designated safe room or the lowest level of your home, preferably a basement.
	- If you don't have a basement, choose an interior room on the lowest floor, away from windows and doors.

3. **Avoid Windows**:
	- Stay away from windows, glass doors, and skylights.
	- Protect yourself from flying debris by getting to the most interior part of the building.

4. **Cover Yourself**:
	- Use heavy furniture, mattresses, or sturdy materials to create a protective barrier around you.
	- If possible, get under a staircase or a heavy piece of furniture for additional protection.

5. **Wear Protective Gear**:
	- If you have access to helmets, bike helmets, or even a mattress, use them to protect your head from potential flying debris.

6. **Listen for Updates**:
	- Keep a battery-powered weather radio with you to receive updates if the power goes out.
	- Pay attention to official announcements and instructions.

7. **Stay Calm**:
	- Encourage others around you to remain calm.
	- Take deep breaths and focus on your emergency plan.

8. **Charge Mobile Devices**:
	- Ensure that your mobile devices are fully charged before the storm hits.
	- Use them sparingly to conserve battery power.

9. **Wait for the All Clear**:
	- Remain in your safe location until you receive an official all-clear signal.
	- Do not go outside prematurely, as there may be multiple tornadoes in a single storm system.

10. **Help Others**:
	- Assist children, elderly family members, and individuals with disabilities in reaching safety.
	- Check on neighbors and offer help if it's safe to do so.

11. **Be Prepared for Aftermath**:
	- Be cautious when leaving your shelter, as there may be debris and hazards.
	- Watch out for downed power lines and other dangers.

12. **Communicate**:
	- Contact your out-of-town emergency contact to let them know you are safe.
	- Use text messages instead of calls to conserve phone battery and network capacity.

Remember, the key to survival during a tornado is preparedness, quick decision-making, and following safety guidelines. Regularly practicing tornado drills with your family or community can significantly improve everyone's ability to respond effectively during an actual emergency.
