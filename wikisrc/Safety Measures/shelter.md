Shelters play a crucial role in providing safety and protection during tornadoes. Whether you're at home, at work, or in a public space, knowing the available shelter options and how to use them effectively is essential for your safety. 

## Types of Shelters
### In-Home Shelters:
- **Basements**: The ideal in-home option. Look for basements with poured concrete walls, no windows, and strong overhead protection. If windows are present, cover them with storm shutters or plywood. Add sturdy doors with deadbolts for extra security.

- **Interior Rooms** on Lowest Floor: If no basement exists, choose an interior room on the lowest floor, away from exterior walls and windows. Closets or bathrooms with no exterior walls can also suffice. Barricade doors with furniture and cover windows with heavy blankets or plywood.

- **Mobile Homes**: Unfortunately, mobile homes offer minimal protection. Seek immediate refuge in a nearby community shelter or sturdy building if a tornado warning is issued.

### Community Shelters:
- **Schools**: Often designated shelters due to their sturdy construction. Look for schools with basements or interior rooms with reinforced walls and no windows. Follow designated pathways and instructions from shelter staff.

- **Community Centers**: Similar to schools, check for sturdy construction and designated safe spaces. These shelters may involve larger crowds, so be prepared for potential delays and prioritize maintaining order.

- **Designated Public Shelters**: These dedicated tornado shelters, often built above or below ground, offer the highest level of protection. They utilize specialized construction and materials to withstand even the most violent tornadoes.

## shelter supplies
### Life-Sustaining Necessities:
- **Water**: Aim for one gallon per person per day, enough to last at least three days. Consider bottled water, water purification tablets, or a portable water filter.

- **Non-Perishable Food**: High-calorie, easy-to-eat options like granola bars, canned goods, crackers, and dried fruit are ideal. Pack a can opener and utensils too.

- **First-Aid Kit**: Bandages, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers, and any necessary medications or medical supplies are crucial for emergency care.

### Comfort and Communication:
- **Blankets and Sleeping Bags**: Stay warm and comfortable during potentially long hours in the shelter. Consider thermal blankets for added insulation.

- **Battery-Powered Radio and Flashlight**: Stay informed about weather updates and navigate in darkness. Extra batteries are essential.

- **Cell Phone Charger**: Keep your communication lifeline charged â€“ a portable power bank can be invaluable.

- **Books, Cards, or Games**: Entertainment helps alleviate stress and boredom, particularly for children. Consider audio books or battery-powered devices for entertainment options.

### Additional Shelter Staples:
- **Wet Wipes and Hand Sanitizer**: Maintain hygiene after potential exposure to debris or contamination.

- **Garbage Bags and Duct Tape**: Useful for cleanup and repairs after the storm.

- **Dust Masks and Gloves**: Protect yourself from airborne debris and hazardous materials.

- **Pet Supplies**: Food, water, and any necessary pet gear for furry companions sharing the shelter.

## Shelter Benefits:
- **Protection from Flying Debris**: Flying debris is the leading cause of injury and death during tornadoes. Shelters provide a secure space shielded from wind-blown objects, significantly reducing the risk of harm.

- **Psychological Comfort**: Knowing you have a designated safe haven amidst the chaos can alleviate fear and anxiety. Having a plan and a designated shelter empowers individuals and families to act calmly and decisively when a tornado warning is issued.

- **Community Resilience**: Public shelters foster a sense of collective safety and support during a crisis. Having access to shared resources and information in a well-equipped shelter can strengthen community bonds and facilitate faster recovery.
